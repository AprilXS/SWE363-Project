# SWE363-Project

how to run the project:
1. clone the project
2. run `npm install` in the client directory
3. run `npm install` in the API directory

5. run 'npm run dev' in the client directory

Note: for the database, we used MongoDB Atlas, so you don't need to install anything, but, the zip folder contains a temporary mongodb link, so you can use it if you want to run the project. but after week, it will be expired, so you need to create your own database in MongoDB Atlas. don't worry, the files are already configured to connect to the database.
