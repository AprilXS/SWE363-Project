# SWE363-Project

Note:

The development took place locally, and we adopted a peer programming approach with Hamza, a leader who has experience in web development, guiding the process. Given that some team members were new to the course content, this collaborative method allowed everyone, regardless of their experience level, to actively participate and receive guidance from Hamza. Hamza, as the leader, considered various aspects such as introducing new learning stacks, managing the learning curve, and navigating unfamiliar areas of knowledge.

During peer programming, Hamza played different roles—observer, coder, or tester—while other team members worked as coders. After each session, Hamza, acting as the leader, hosted the code to validate requirements and perform acceptance testing. Following this validation, only Hamza committed and pushed the code to the repository. This streamlined approach ensured a controlled and cohesive codebase, with Hamza as the gatekeeper for each validated contribution. This method not only fostered collaboration but also provided a structured way to integrate code and manage the repository.

The database mongoDB connictoin was remove to make the repository public

how to run the project:
1. clone the project
2. run `npm install` in the client directory
3. run `npm install` in the API directory
4. run 'node index.js' in the API directory
5. run 'npm run dev' in the client directory
6. open the browser.

Note: for the database, we used MongoDB Atlas, so you don't need to install anything, but, the zip folder contains a temporary mongodb link, so you can use it if you want to run the project. but after week, it will be expired, so you need to create your own database in MongoDB Atlas. don't worry, the files are already configured to connect to the database.
